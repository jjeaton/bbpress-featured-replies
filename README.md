## Description ##

Lets the admin add "featured" or "buried" css class to selected bbPress replies. Handy to highlight notable replies or bury "Thanks/me too" and other useless responses. The plugin also gives the user that started the topic the capability to choose featured/buried replies. Also includes a widget for showing recently featured replies.

This plugin is based on [Featured Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/feature-comments/) by Pippin Williamson.
